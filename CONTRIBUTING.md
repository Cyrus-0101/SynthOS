# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.  Most contributions require you to fork the repository and cannot push directly to the master branch. After creating a PR, a workflow will review the code together with one of our members to ensure, that you follow the the same rules used by the team

* Linting Rules.
* Variable Naming Convention.
* File Structure Convention.
* CLEAN & DRY Code Formatting.

If the above checks out then a member of the team will get back to your PR in less than 24hrs, and accept (hopefully), the changes made, pushing the changes to the main staging application.

Welcome to Contributing to Open Source :)
